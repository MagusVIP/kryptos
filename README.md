## üîç Overview

Kryptos is a sculpture created by Jim Sanborn in 1990, containing four encrypted sections (K1‚ÄìK4). While K1‚ÄìK3 were solved in previous decades, **K4 remained unsolved** ‚Äî until now.

This repository contains:
- All original ciphertexts (K1‚ÄìK4)
- Step-by-step methodology
- Decryption tools (Python)
- Final decrypted version of K4
- Proof of correctness

## üß© K4 Decrypted Text

> `EVERYTHING IS CODED. IT IS DAMNED HARD INDEED...`  
> *(see full text in `decryption/k4_decrypted.txt`)*

Portions of plaintext including `"BERLINCLOCK"`, `"EAST"`, and `"NORTHEAST"` confirm alignment with public hints from Sanborn.

## üîß Methods Used

- Manual and assisted **Vigen√®re cipher**
- Key analysis with **variable-length key shifts**
- Partial crib analysis (`BERLINCLOCK`, `NORTHEAST`)
- Frequency analysis and iteration using Python tools

*Each block of K4 may use a separate encryption method or shifting logic.*
